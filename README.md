# Theme Idea
#### We want to make a newspaper based in the fictional Marvel Universe
#### It will be based on real-life news and fictional news like the Xenonion.  We will each write several brief articles for different sections.  We are currently planning on Global News, Business+Finance, Opinion, and Entertainment.
#### We currently or are planning on implementing:
#### 1. A scrolling highlights reel at the front page
#### 2. 4 different article sections: Breaking News, Entertainment, Opinions, and Politics.  Each section has their own page.
#### 3. Several funny articles
#### 4. Humorous fictional "advertisements"
#### 5. An API of the r/marvel subreddit on the front page
# Progress Journal
## Sprint 2
### Week 3
#### This week we were introduced to binary, a number system that computers use to store data.  We started a new mini-project related to binary.
#### So far we have decided on our theme and have been focusing on learning computer science skills and preparing our website+development skills in preparation for the larger project.
#### We have created a [mini-project page](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/sus.html), [a dropdown menu for the about us pages](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/5), [customized about us pages](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/7), [and made a custom readme](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/4).
### Week 4
#### This week we reviewed our previous binary lesson, and we also learned about data compression and RGB.
#### Our website grew with a [new homepage with an article slideshow](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/2), [a new CSS theme](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/2), and [a page to put soon-to-be articles](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/2).
#### We have continued working on the binary project where we [finished most of the hacks](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/8), and [got the images of the lightbulbs to change](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/9).
| Requirements | Evidence |
| :----- | :----- |
| Binary Project | Almost done. With few exceptions, all HACK objectives have been completed. New buttons have been added that change the images on the page. CSS has been customized.  Input area has not been completed.![binarypage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/133879280-9e10e3f1-a3fd-4b1a-a728-566f6b1180b5.PNG) ![thonaspage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/133879296-7766613d-ca87-4d2e-9bd3-fdafdc14fa52.PNG) | 
## Sprint 3
### Week 5
#### This week we worked on the RGB project that applied last week's RGB lesson.
| Requirements | Evidence |
| :----- | :----- |
| RGB Project |  While the backend of the RGB project is complete, the frontend is visually lacking.  It is able to display the contents of the RGB project but it is disorganized and stripped of any styling. The image_data function was optimized using Big O notation and text was added to the images with Pillow. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/134606070-dfd97632-e32e-4341-8331-aee2cef86d6c.png) |
 
| Individual Work | Description |
| :----- | :----- |
| Sophie Park | Sophie has gotten the backend set up and has finished all backend Hack tasks.  She used pillow to write "MARVEL" in red text. Since the sizes of the images varied a lot she found a way to make a different font size+position for each image. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/13). Sophie has also finished the Base2^n study journal. It is on her journal. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/17) |
| Punarvasu Sangam | Due to being missing for almost the entire last week, Punnu has not a lot of work has been done yet. That is fine for now. He already has some development ideas that he is going to implement soon. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/16) |
| Ethan Guo | Ethan has been able to dramatically improve the efficiency of the image_data function.  It went from being O(n x m) to O(n) which is significantly better than before. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/15) |
| Jason Kaplan | Jason has already set up the frontend to be able to display the right data and get it to look nice. He has finished the Hack Assignment and now has a working button that turns all images to gray_scale. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/14) |
### Week 6
| Requirements | Evidence |
| :----- | :------ |
| RGB Project | The RGB project is now essentially finished.  The layout has been fixed and the backend text-writing, the front-end greyscale, and the image_data BigO notation are all functional.  The [project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0HJV9DaE6A2R0R5cqNIFT2G01R6gcRTk_YQLqi-JYE/edit#heading=h.baeoff914e24) is also complete ![rgb_week6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/135728508-3905ab3e-b7ec-44e6-97dc-33f97990a848.PNG) |

| Individual Work | Description |
| :----- | :----- |
| Sophie Park | Sophie finished the backend and Base2^n study journal last week.  She did the [RGB project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0HJV9DaE6A2R0R5cqNIFT2G01R6gcRTk_YQLqi-JYE/edit#heading=h.baeoff914e24) this week. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/24) |
| Punarvasu Sangam | Punnu has managed to get some rotation working along with a button, but there's a little surprise (it rotates the entire webpage instead of just the images).  [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/16) |
| Ethan Guo | The Big O notation has finished and the new code has been finished. It is able to properly work now and instead of being O(n^2) it is now O(n). [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/15) |
| Jason Kaplan | Jason got the frontend greyscale switch to work. The website has a navbar and is correctly formatted as well.  [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/14) |

| Individual Work | Description |
| :----- | :----- |
| Sophie Park | Sophie has completed both signed and unsigned addition.  She created separate IDs and functions for each row and created a function to add the two numbers. [Signed Addition](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/25), [Unsigned Addition](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/29)|
| Punarvasu Sangam | Punnu was in charge of doing the Logic Gates portion of this assignment. He has put in 8 logic gates; the Buffer, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XNOR. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/26) |
| Ethan Guo | Ethan was assigned to adding the shift buttons and the unicode display onto the binary project.  The shift buttons are working well, they are able to multiply and divide a number by 2 (decimal results round down in the lighbulb display). The problem is the display bar of the binary project will wrongly show .5. Ethan has tried using the floor() function to sove this but was unsuccessful. The unicode also has a slight problem; although unicode is displayed, it is not displayed with ASCII. [Shift](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/28), [Unicode](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/23)|
| Jason Kaplan | Jason has completed the color code project.  It has a bit toggle and color display for each color in RGB and also shows the combined color below. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/27)|'
### Week 8
#### This week we focused on developing the theme of our website:
| Individual Work | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Sophie Park | Sophie got the r/marvel api working and re-designed the CSS for the website to be more like a formal newspaper. She is in charge of the politics articles.  [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/dailybugle/issues/1) |
| Punarvusu Sangam | Punnu planned and made several advertisements.  Punu is in charge of the Entertianment section. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/dailybugle/issues/2) |
| Ethan Guo | Ethan worked with Jason to make several article ideas+plan out the structure of the website. Ethan is in charge of the Opinions section.  [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/dailybugle/issues/3) |
| Jason Kaplan | Jason has gotten a sample slide scroll to work and is waiting for articles to implement them.  Jason is in charge of the Breaking News section. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/dailybugle/issues/5) |
