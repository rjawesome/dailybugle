##Theme Idea
#### We want to make a newspaper based in the fictional Marvel Universe.  More specifically, we ant to bring the fictional newspaper *Daily Bugle* to life.
#### It will be based on real-life news and fictional news like the Xenonion.
#### We will each write several brief articles for different sections.  We are currently planning on Global News, Buisness+Finance, Opinion, and Entertainment.
