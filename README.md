# Theme Idea
#### We want to make a newspaper based in the fictional Marvel Universe
#### It will be based on real-life news and fictional news like the Xenonion.  We will each write several brief articles for different sections.  We are currently planning on Global News, Business+Finance, Opinion, and Entertainment.
#### We will likely need:
##### 1. To write several ~1-paragraph long articles
##### 2. Different pages for each section (index.html will be highlights from all sections and the newest articles)
##### 3. Stacked, floating boxes in columns that are links to articles
##### 4. A potential scrolling article highlights at the front of the page
##### 5. Humorous fictional "advertisements"
# Progress Journal
## Sprint 2
### Week 3
#### This week we were introduced to binary, a number system that computers use to store data.  We started a new mini-project related to binary.
#### So far we have decided on our theme and have been focusing on learning computer science skills and preparing our website+development skills in preparation for the larger project.
#### We have created a [mini-project page](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/sus.html), [a dropdown menu for the about us pages](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/5), [customized about us pages](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/7), [and made a custom readme](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/4).
### Week 4
#### This week we reviewed our previous binary lesson, and we also learned about data compression and RGB.
#### Our website grew with a [new homepage with an article slideshow](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/2), [a new CSS theme](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/2), and [a page to put soon-to-be articles](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/2).
#### We have continued working on the binary project where we [finished most of the hacks](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/8), and [got the images of the lightbulbs to change](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/9).
| Requirements | Evidence |
| :---- | :---- |
| Binary Project | Almost done. With few exceptions, all HACK objectives have been completed. New buttons have been added that change the images on the page. CSS has been customized.  Input area has not been completed.![binarypage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/133879280-9e10e3f1-a3fd-4b1a-a728-566f6b1180b5.PNG) ![thonaspage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/133879296-7766613d-ca87-4d2e-9bd3-fdafdc14fa52.PNG) | 
## Sprint 3
### Week 5
#### This week we worked on the RGB project that applied last week's RGB lesson.
| Requirements | Evidence |
| :---- | :---- |
| RGB Project |  While the backend of the RGB project is complete, the frontend is visually lacking.  It is able to display the contents of the RGB project but it is disorganized and stripped of any styling. The image_data function was optimized using Big O notation and text was added to the images with Pillow. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/134606070-dfd97632-e32e-4341-8331-aee2cef86d6c.png) |
 
| Individual Work | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Ethan Guo | Ethan has been able to dramatically improve the efficiency of the image_data function.  It went from being O(n x m) to O(n) which is significantly better than before. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/15)
| Sophie Park | Sophie has gotten the backend set up and has finished all backend Hack tasks.  She used pillow to write "MARVEL" in red text. Since the sizes of the images varied a lot she found a way to make a different font size+position for each image. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/13). Sophie has also finished the Base2^n study journal. It is on her journal. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/17) 
| Punarvasu Sangam | Due to being missing for almost the entire last week, Punnu has not a lot of work has been done yet. That is fine for now. He already has some development ideas that he is going to implement soon. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/16) 
| Jason Kaplan | Jason has already set up the frontend to be able to display the right data and get it to look nice. He has finished the Hack Assignment and now has a working button that turns all images to gray_scale. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/14) |
### Week 6
| Requirements | Evidence |
| :---- | :----- |
| RGB Project | The RGB project is now essentially finished.  The layout has been fixed and the backend text-writing, the front-end greyscale, and the image_data BigO notation are all functional.  The [project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0HJV9DaE6A2R0R5cqNIFT2G01R6gcRTk_YQLqi-JYE/edit#heading=h.baeoff914e24) is also complete ![rgb_week6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82109882/135728508-3905ab3e-b7ec-44e6-97dc-33f97990a848.PNG) |

| Individual Work | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Ethan Guo |  |
| Sophie Park | Sophie finished the backend and Base2^n study journal last week.  She did the [RGB project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p0HJV9DaE6A2R0R5cqNIFT2G01R6gcRTk_YQLqi-JYE/edit#heading=h.baeoff914e24) this week. [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/24) |
| Punarvasu Sangam | Punnu has managed to get some rotation working along with a button, but there's a little surprise.  [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/16) |
| Jason Kaplan | Jason got the frontend greyscale switch to work. The website has a navbar and is correctly formatted as well.  [Issue](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/14) |
