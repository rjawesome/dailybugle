## Theme Idea
#### We want to make a newspaper based in the fictional Marvel Universe.
#### It will be based on real-life news and fictional news like the Xenonion.  We will each write several brief articles for different sections.  We are currently planning on Global News, Buisness+Finance, Opinion, and Entertainment.
#### We will likely need:
##### 1. To write several ~1-paragraph long articles
##### 2. Different pages for each section (index.html will be hilights from all sections and the newest articles)
##### 3. Stacked, floating boxes in collumns that are links to articles
##### 4. A potential scrolling article hilights at the front of the page
##### 5. Humerous fictional "advertisements"
## Progress Journal
### Week 3+4
#### So far we have decided on our theme and have been focusing on learning computer science skills and preparing our website+development skills in preparation for the larger project.
#### We have created a [mini-project page](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/sus.html), [a dropdown menu for the about us pages](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/5), [customized about us pages](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/7), [and made a custom readme](https://github.com/CalrethilOfMirkwood/flask_portfolio/issues/4).
